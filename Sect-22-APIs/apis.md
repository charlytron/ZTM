# APIs
---

Application programming interface is a messenger that takes a request and
tells the system what to do.  But what is it, exactly ;)

skyscanner.com is an aggregator website.  On it we look for a flight and it
searches all the websites, airlines for the best deals. 

How is it able to do this.  Skyscanner does not store this information. The
information is somewhere in the database of each individual airline.

As an airline you have an interest in having your rates posted on Skyscanner
because people who wish to book a flight might not go to the airline's 
proprietary website.

Having their information listed on Skyscanner makes them more money. How is 
Skyscanner able to display the prices without having this information themselves?

That's where APIs come in handy; they allow strangers to speak to eachother so
that we aren't in a closed system. We can share data and work with eachother.
(This would be anathema to the old school craft guilds, but that's another topic).

An API allows computers to communicate with eachother.  It's reminiscent of
how web browsers speak with servers. But API itself is a broad topic, and it
applies to the way that machines communicate.

Something as simple as window.fetch() is really an API.
